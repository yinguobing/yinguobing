### Hi there 👋

I'm Yin Guobing (in Chinese: 尹国冰), a real human being! :runner:

I was born and grown up in China, a place of long history and ancient culture. After getting my master's degree in physics, I unwittingly broke into the world of computer vision and started my adventure. This is a place where I keep my open source projects that you might find helpful. 🌱

These projects do not aim to replace the existing mature solutions, instead, they consider the ease of understanding as first priority and were written with care and :heart:. Most of them also have companian posts and videos which make them easier to understand through visual illustration. You can find them on my [website](https://yinguobing.com/playground/).

如果您有在广州的工作机会，欢迎联系！
