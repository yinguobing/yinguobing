### Hi there 👋

I'm Yin Guobing (in Chinese: 尹国冰), a real human being! :runner:

I was born and grown up in China, a place of long history and ancient culture. After getting my master's degree in physics, I unwittingly broke into the world of computer vision and started my adventure. This is a place where I keep my open source projects which you might find helpful. 🌱

The projects I’m currently working on are deep learning based image processing applications such as face detection, facial landmark detection, face recognition, etc. These projects do not aim to replace the existing mature solutions, instead, they consider the ease of understanding as first priority and were all written with care and :heart:. Most of them also have companian posts and videos which make them easier to understand through visual illustration. You can find them on my [website](https://yinguobing.com/playground/).

如果您有在广州的工作机会，欢迎联系！
